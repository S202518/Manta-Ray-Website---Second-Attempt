                <h2>Manta Ray's Diet</h2>
                <p>Despite their status as an ocean giant, manta rays feed on some of the smallest organisms in the sea! 
                    They are planktivores, feeding especially on zooplankton and other tiny animals.

                <h2>Where They Live</h2>
                <p>
                    The giant manta ray is found worldwide in tropical, subtropical, and temperate bodies of water and is commonly found offshore, 
                    in oceanic waters, and in productive coastal areas. 
                    The species has also been observed in estuarine waters, oceanic inlets, and within bays and intercoastal waterways.

                <h2>Mantilla</h2>
                <p>
                    The name manta comes from the Spanish word “Mantilla” or cloak. 
                    First described in 1798, it was believed there was one single species of manta until 2009, 
                    when Dr. Andrea Marshall identified the difference between the two current species.

                <h2>The Gentle Giants of The Sea</h2>
                <p>
                    Manta rays are giants of their kind, with the largest individuals reaching seven metres in width and weighing up to two tonnes. 
                    Despite their colossal presence, mantas are gentle creatures. 
                    They have the largest brains of all fish, and their intelligence and curiosity make encounters with manta rays a truly magical experience. 
                    It is little wonder that for many years they have been well-known and loved by the SCUBA diving community. 
                    More recently, they have also found mainstream popularity with a wider, global audience, featuring in ground-breaking wildlife documentaries such as the Blue Planet II. 
                    Their obvious intellect and complex social interactions set manta rays apart from other fish, 
                    but as they have only been scientifically studied in detail for around a decade, much of their life history remains a mystery.
